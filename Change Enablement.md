# What is Change Enablement
## David Armstrong 08-31-2020

Change enablement (formerly known as Change Management) is a term which changed with the release of ITIL 4 in 2019. This is a process which lays out a framework for successful Requests for Change by properly assessing risks and making sure that there is proper oversight from the change authority.

There are 3 main levels of RFCs: 
- Standard: low risk, well documented change that is usually routinely carried out and does not need additional authorization.
- Normal: a change that needs to be assessed, scheduled and requires authorization.
- Emergency: a change which requires immediate action and might forego formal authorization in order to allow for expedited implementation.

The change goes thru specific steps including assessment, approval and oversight by a change authority (a single person of authority or a panel of supervisors or managers), and change schedule. Change enablement is central to the activities of the service value chain.
