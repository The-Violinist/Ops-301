VPN tunneling is the term for how data is sent from a VPN network to another. The data is “tunneled” by encapsulating and encrypting the data packets 
thereby making them invisible (or rather unreadable). There are different protocols featured with each VPN which optimize them for a specific use. 
Some of these include greater security, speed, software traversing, and ease of access. One specific feature is split tunneling which allows for using 
tunneling when needed and not for less security sensitive data.

There are 5 types of VPN: Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP), Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP), Internet Protocol Security (IPSec), 
and Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol (SSTP), and Open VPN (SSL/TLS). These become more secure in descending order. The speed and security of the
last 3 are the best and they are the best at bypassing blocking software (especially SSTP and Open VPN).
