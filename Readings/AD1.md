# AD part 1

Microsoft Active Directory (AD) enables network administrators to monitor and manage resources. This includes files and folders all the way up to users/groups and network assets. AD can also be used to grant or remove access to computers and accounts. Released in 1999, AD was released at the same time as Windows Server 2000. While AD is something which is “used” by (or affects) almost every employee where it is deployed, it is used as a tool by network admins.

Active Directory can manage objects. By using GPOs (group policy objects) admins can make changes to every object within a group by applying one overall policy. Everything within AD is grouped according to its hierarchy within the following scheme: Forest, Tree, Domain, Object. All of these features are accomplished by  Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) which tracks the objects by creating a database.
