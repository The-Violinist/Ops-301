# What is hardening?

Hardening techniques refers to reducing possible vulnerabilities on a computer. This can be anything from making sure that updates are being performed, to reducing unneeded apps, to BIOS configuration and making sure that proper firewalls and AV are in place. The list goes on, but the main idea is reducing surface area in order to reduce areas of vulnerability.

This is where endpoint agents come into play. This is something that ensures that all of the hardening is being done. The main considerations for endpoint agents are the footprint on the system and effectiveness for the specific situation with the overall network in mind.
