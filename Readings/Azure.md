# What is Azure?
## David Armstrong 09-14-2020

Azure is Microsoft’s Caas platform which is geared towards businesses and organizations. It encompasses everything for infrastructure that is needed for today’s business: VMs, file storage servers, email servers, databases, and user directories (among many other offerings). One of the major benefits of using Azure over traditional network infrastructure is the ability to have exactly the computing power and resources that are needed at any given time. Meaning, these resources can be allocated and removed quickly. The result is that one only pays for what is needed. 

In addition to the general computing abilities, Azure comes equipped with the cloud version of Active Directory. This allows companies to use RBAC methods of administration over their server (or servers) as if it was an on prem network. The Azure AD can be set up as the authoritative directory thereby avoiding any clash between on prem and cloud AD. In addition, this allows for single sign on for all services should the company use multiple offerings from Microsoft, allowing for better integration between different software. An added security benefit is the ability to use multi-factor authentication.
