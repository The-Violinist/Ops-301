# What is Network Segmentation?
## David Armstrong 09-08-2020

Network Segmentation is a way in which network administrators can break up a single network into small chunks, or segments. This is done for many reasons. The primary purpose is to create greater security. In much of the security world today, there is (rightly so) a commonly adopted strategy known as zero trust. This assumes that anyone can and will do harm to the system whether intentional or accidental.

Segmentation goes a long way to preventing users from accessing parts of a network that they donâ€™t need access to. It also helps to prevent an attack from bringing down an entire network should it be successful.

The main purposes of segmentation are: Improving performance, limiting attack, protecting vulnerable devices, and to aid in regulatory compliance. Separating categories or departments of objects into different areas -- whether logical or physical -- provides improvements in all of these areas.
