# Patch Managment
## David Armstrong 09-14-2020

Patch management is the act of proactively monitoring systems and installing needed updates as they come available. This is done, on large scale, by using a software which manages the updating of an entire network. This provides better productivity, security, and possibly aids with compliance with laws in some cases. The key components of such a system are centralized update management and automation.

There are three type of patches are feature updates (major milestone updates), bug fixes, and security patches. Since each type does not carry the same degree of severity, it stands to reason that they donâ€™t need to be treated the same. The is where an update manager is very helpful. 

While there are different options available, the Windows Server Update Services is a great option if your organization uses Windows server. WSUS servers can be set up to contact the Windows update database and pull the update files, then push them out to all of the attached computers.
