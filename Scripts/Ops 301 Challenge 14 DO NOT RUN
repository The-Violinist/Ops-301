#Bottom line: This virus does not do what it says in the scenario. If syntactically correct, it would erase every python file and replace it with the first 39 lines of code
#from this file
#There are places where it becomes very confusing as to whether or not a variable is being used globally or where there is recursion.
#I guess I'm just not sure what the intended outcome of this virus is.
