To begin with, why be inclusive and support diversity? Some of the main reasons include the research which shows 
that diverse teams are smarter and more creative. From a broader standpoint, diverse companies perform better 
(financially and KPI) and are better able to serve a more diverse user base. Without inclusivity, companies 
stand to miss many opportunities for a great talent pool. But the bottom line, as the article states: Itâ€™s the 
right thing to do!

The need for increased diversity in tech can be traced all the way back to the 1980s according to Elizabeth 
Ames from the Anita Borg Institute for Women in Technology. According to Ames, the marketing campaigns from 
30 years ago were aimed exclusively at boys and men which has now led to an experience gap. There is reported 
an almost 4:1 ratio of men pursuing degrees in tech as opposed to women.
