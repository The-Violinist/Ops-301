# What is SQL
## David Armstrong 09-17-2020

SQL, or structured query language, is a means of accessing and manipulating data within its database. Databases are used through what is called a database management system (DBMS). There are 4 types of DBMS: Hierarchical, Network, Relational, and Object oriented. Of these, SQL falls into the relational.

As many web based companies have come to rely very heavily on databases for  use with dynamic web servers they have developed their own form of database which is referred to as NoSQL (not only SQL). This form works very well for scaling outwards and is very useful for this application (very good with huge volumes of data). However, due to the more structured format of SQL, this format will not be going away anytime soon due in part to having better security.
